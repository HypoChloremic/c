// with your own custom code.

// You should also change the Alias value in the AppExecutionAlias Extension
// in the package.appxmanifest to a value that you define. To edit this file
// manually, open it with the XML Editor.

// Ajt, so it seems that we can easily wrinf integers, it is
// just that I cannot seem to be printing, or outputting doubles
// On the other hand, the src demonstrates the ability to be passing values
// to methods relatively easily.
